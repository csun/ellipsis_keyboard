This is a stripped version of [QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware). The only keyboard firmware in here is for the Ellipsis.

To build the firmware, run `make ellipsis:default`, then use the Teensy flashing thing to flash.

If more people build Ellipses, it would be good to merge this with the QMK master.
